## 💡 Innovations Added

### 🔤 Multilingual Support (Hindi, Telugu & More)
To enhance accessibility, a **language selection feature** has been proposed at the start of the conversation. This helps students from non-English backgrounds feel more comfortable and understood.

### 📊 Analytics for Future Improvement
If further developed, analytics can be added to monitor:
- Where users drop off (e.g., fee info, eligibility check)
- Which steps need more clarity or empathy
This feedback can help improve assistant performance and increase admissions.
